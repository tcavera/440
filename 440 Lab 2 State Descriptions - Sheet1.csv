State,Description
q0,Starting state. Moving the goat is the only option that would lead to a possible solution from here. Any other move would lead to the error state q9. 
q1,"State that points to states q0, q9, and q2. q1 must be reached in all possible solutions."
q2,"State that points to states q1, q9, q7, and q3. q2 must be reached in all possible solutions."
q3,"State that points to states q2, q9, and q4. Can be neglected in a solution."
q4,"State that points to states q3, q9, and q5. Can be neglected in a possible solution. "
q5,"State that points to states q4, q8, q9, and q6. q5 must be reached in all possible solutions."
q6,"State that points to states q5, q9, and the accepted state q10. q6 must be reached in all possilbe solutions."
q7,"State that points to states q2, q9, and q8. Can be neglectedf in a solution."
q8,"State that points to states q7, q9, and q5. Can be neglected in a possible solution."
q9,"The error state. All other states, including this state itself, can transiton to this state if invalid moves are made. "
q10,"The accepted state. Only reached via state q6, and can transition to the error state if any extra invalid moves are made. "
